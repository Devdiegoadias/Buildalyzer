# 3.1.1

# 3.1.0

- Added `SourceFiles` and `References` for F# projects (#146, thanks @dukedagmor)
- Fixed an inconsistency between Buildalyzer and MSBuild by adding a trailing directory separator to the solution path (#147, #148, thanks @laurenceSaes)

# 3.0.1

- Fixed (hopefully) several bugs related to concurrency (#142, #134, #138, thanks @duncanawoods and @SierraNL).

# 3.0.0

- Added support for specifying additional MSBuild arguments via `EnvironmentOptions.Arguments`.
- Updated the MSBuild.StructuredLogger package to version 2.1.133
- Updated MSBuild packages to 16.5.0 (#140, thanks @colombod)
